# Roommate Reminders (working title, app in development)
## A group organization app made for roommates

### Features:
* Create many types of reminders, stored in a Mongo database
* Live updates, reminders will render on screen as they are created
* Around the house chores can be added and be repeated at intervals set by the user. If you want to rotate the chores, the app 
will keep up with this and rotate chores automatically, so you never have to remember who vacuumed last. The same applies for
the group shopping list.
* If one member helps pick up the tab on a meal when another is short, they can add an IOU with the amount, reason, and date. 
*Users can add bills with a total amount and it will automatically be divided evenly 
among all household members. Users can also add due dates and turn on optional push notifications to make sure they never miss
a payment. 


### Goals:
* Each household member creates an account and gets added to their 'home', or group
* Users can copy and paste a link to each bill's respective online payment site for added convenience. 
* Around the house chores can be added and be repeated at intervals set by the user. If you want to rotate the chores, the app 
will keep up with this and rotate chores automatically, so you never have to remember who vacuumed last. The same applies for
the group shopping list.
* If you expected your roommate home a few hours ago and you haven't heard from them, you can view their profile from the app
"check in" with them by touching a button. This will send your roommate a notification and they can respond to let you know 
they're fine and what time they'll be home.

### Challenges: 
* This app is something I designed for my roommates and myself to help solve a lot of the issues we've always had, and to help
me get out of my comfort zone. I'm developing it with React Native for cross-platform compatibility, and also because I would 
like to refine my skills in React. With that comes the challenge of finding ways to develop the features I would like to 
implement. 
* I would like to create a UI that is clean and simple, yet still feels fully featured. Another way I'm getting myself out of
my comfort zone is UI design/implementation. I generally don't enjoy beautifying pages, but I feel like it is a viable skill to
have. 

### Development Status:
I am currently working on user account creation with passport.js. After that is complete, I'll start working down the list of 
goals. My goals will probably continue to be added to as I think of new features. I still think my UI is a little lacking, so 
that is also in the works.
